Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework. This guide will help you get started with a new project. See the manual setup instructions to add Starlight to an existing Astro project.

## Quick Start

### Create a New Project

Create a new Astro + Starlight project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm create astro --template starlight
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn create astro --template starlight
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new <a href="#">project directory</a> with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

Astro helps you build faster websites with [“open the template on StackBlitz”](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/starlight/tree/main/examples/basics).

### Start the development server

When working locally, <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev">Astro’s development server</a> lets you preview your work and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes. 

Inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview. Open this URL to start browsing your site.

### Add content

Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

Add new pages to your site by creating Markdown files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.

Read more about file-based routing and support for MDX and Markdoc files in the <a href="">“Pages”</a> guide.

### Next steps

<ul>
    <li> **Configure:** Learn about common options in ["Customizing Starlight."]()   </li>
    <li> **Navigate:** Set up your sidebar with the ["Sidebar Navigation"]() guide.  </li>
    <li> **Components:** Discover built-in cards, tabs, and more in the ["Components"]() guide.  </li>
    <li> **Deploy:** Publish your work with the ["Deploy your site"]() guide in the Astro docs.</li>
</ul>

## Updating Starlight

:::tip[Did you know?]
Because Starlight is beta software, there will be frequent updates and improvements. Be sure to update Starlight regularly!
:::

Starlight is an Astro integration. You can update it and other Astro packages by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx @astrojs/upgrade
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx @astrojs/upgrade
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx @astrojs/upgrade
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See the ["Starlight changelog"]() for a full list of the changes made in each release.
